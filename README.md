# What is Cryptocurrency

This interactive visual aid is made with [impress.js](https://github.com/henrikingo/impress.js.git) to support a talk that I originally gave on 09 May 2018 at the Vermilion, OH rotary club.

Navigate using the arrow keys, or the worn cloud that appears on the third slide. A working version is hosted at [https://joshorndorff.github.io/What-is-Cryptocurrency/](https://joshorndorff.github.io/What-is-Cryptocurrency/)

## How to use

Open `index.html` in a modern browser like Firefox or Chromium

## Todo
* Insert links to sources and rsources throughout
* Add substeps to some slides
* Beautify
* Diagnose bullets on smart contract slide in chromium
